# Homework-Two
First Commit - Fixed the "Search Engine Option" link to properly function.

Second Commit - Replaced the "Header" div with an actual Header tag.

Third Commit - Replace the "footer" div with an actual footer tag.

Fourth Commit - Added a "back to top" link,  I don't know if this is something you guys were looking for but for me,  when I clicked the links and it sent me down I thought maybe if I could just click a button instead of scroll back up.  Maybe it isn't needed but thought about functionality.

Fifth Commit - Css had a style that had a duplicate so I removed that.
